## Development 👨‍💻

This project is built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), which is a JavaScript framework (built on top of [React](https://reactjs.org/)) for creating cool websites.
The project also utilizes [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax#scss) for styling the various page elements.

### Types of Files 📁

Do not be discouraged/intimidated by any files that have unfamiliar file extensions.
Mainly, there are two types of files to work with in this project:

`.tsx`: These files allow you to write HTML elements in TypeScript.
They are used to represent components and pages in Gatsby.

`.scss`: These files allow you to refer to the HTML in the `.tsx` files and style them using a superset of CSS.

### Getting Started 🏁

To get started with developing, [fork](https://github.com/TuffyHacks/TuffyHacks-2021/fork) this repository and open it in your development environment of choice.
Check out [_An Introduction to Open Source_](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/an-introduction-to-open-source) to learn how to contribute in a helpful way.

Once situated, just run `npm i` at the root of the project and then run `npm run dev` to spin up the development server.
You will know if the development server is up-and-running correctly when you visit your [localhost](http://localhost:8000/) at port 8000.
Now that the development server is up-and-running, you can make changes to the source code and the development server will hot-reload and immediately show your changes on [localhost](http://localhost:8000/) at port 8000.

Once you are done making your changes, update the [todo](#todo-) by marking off your task and [create a pull request](https://github.com/TuffyHacks/TuffyHacks-2021/compare) to the repository.
