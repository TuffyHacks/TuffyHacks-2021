## Development üë®‚Äçüíª

To get started with developing, [fork](https://github.com/TuffyHacks/TuffyHacks-2021/fork) this repository and open it in your development environment of choice.
Check out [_An Introduction to Open Source_](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/an-introduction-to-open-source) to learn how to contribute in a helpful way.

Once situated, just run `npm i` at the root of the project and then run `npm run dev` to spin up the development server.
You will know if the development server is up-and-running correctly when you visit your [localhost](http://localhost:8000/) at port 8000.
Now that the development server is up-and-running, you can make changes to the source code and the development server will hot-reload and immediately show your changes on [localhost](http://localhost:8000/) at port 8000.

Once you are done making your changes, update the [todo](#todo-) by marking off your task and [create a pull request](https://github.com/TuffyHacks/TuffyHacks-2021/compare) to the repository.
