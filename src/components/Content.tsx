            Empowering Students TuffyHacks is Cal State Fullerton's student-run
            hackathon for beginners and first-time hackers, where participants
            from all our college create innovative products in 24 hours. This
            year, our hackathon will be held virtually on March 27 - 28th,
            meaning you can participate from the comfort of your own home! Come
            learn new topics with recorded workshops ranging from open-source
            software to creating your own DiscordBot. Meet our sponsors at their
            networking events. Your project also has the chance to win some of
            our cool prizes!
